# Redeyed Sentinel CAPTCHA (Drupal 10/11)

Add friendly, privacy-respecting human verification to your Drupal **login**
and **registration** forms with [Redeyed Sentinel](https://redeyed.com). This is
a standalone module — it does **not** require the contrib CAPTCHA module.

**Free to install.** The module stays inert until you add your keys. With no
keys the widget renders nothing and verification fails open, so your forms keep
working while you get set up.

## Install

1. Copy the `redeyed_sentinel` folder into your site's
   `modules/custom/` directory:

   ```
   web/modules/custom/redeyed_sentinel/
   ```

   (Or require it with Composer if you publish it to a package repository.)

2. Enable the module:

   ```bash
   drush en redeyed_sentinel
   ```

   Or via the UI at **Extend** (`/admin/modules`).

## Configure

Grab a **Site Key** and **Secret Key** from the Redeyed Lab:
**Sentinel → Sites**. The Secret Key is shown only once, when you create the
site — copy it then.

Go to **Administration → Configuration → People → Redeyed Sentinel CAPTCHA**
(`/admin/config/people/redeyed-captcha`) and enter:

| Field        | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Site key     | Public key that renders the widget. Safe to expose. |
| Secret key   | Secret key used only for server-side verification. Keep private. |
| Base URL     | Sentinel service URL. Defaults to `https://redeyed.com`. |

> Until **both** the site key and secret key are set the module is **inert**:
> nothing renders and verification passes automatically (fail open). Forms are
> never blocked by missing configuration.

## How it works

| Step   | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Render | `hook_form_alter()` adds `{base_url}/sentinel.js` and a `sentinel-captcha` div (using your site key) to the login and registration forms. |
| Submit | The Sentinel widget injects a hidden `sentinel-token` field. |
| Verify | A validation handler POSTs to `{base_url}/sentinel/siteverify` via `\Drupal::httpClient()` with body `{"secret": "...", "response": "...", "remoteip": "..."}` (the `remoteip` is the client IP and is optional). |
| Pass   | Only when the JSON response has top-level `success === true` (the response also carries `outcome` and `score`); otherwise the form shows *"Human verification failed — please try again."* |

The secret key is sent only in the request body — never rendered to the page or
written to logs. This is a reCAPTCHA/Turnstile-style flow: your site's own
secret key authenticates the verify call, so no developer API key is required.
